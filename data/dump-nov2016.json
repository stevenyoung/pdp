Having returned there after many years, Condon takes the reader on a unique and personal journey through contemporary Brisbane, unearthing its history --sometimes literally --and painting a portrait of its transformation.

Melancholic without being sentimental, Brisbane tells of a city where mango trees abound, where the serpentine river seems to be of the city and yet somehow not, where ghostly memories of demolished landmarks, like Cloudland and The Bellevue Hotel, hover.

This was a death urge, and I did nothing. The tiger had no remotely mechanical aspect to it, nor appeared in any sense to have emerged from underground or be about to return to fugitive excavations, seemed instead to be wholly of flesh and fur, leather-black nostrils steaming above a grizzly muzzle baring just the slightest fang tips and fringed with beaded ice, its own refrozen breath or drool.

In those days, the Ningy Ningy people of Redcliffe and Toorbul lived a traditional life, hunting and fishing as their forefathers had done before them for thousands of years. The first half of this novel describes their life. Matthew Flinders noted the names of three of the people, Yelbah, Bomaringo and Yewoo and these are taken as the main characters in this book. Their lives changed in 1823 when they welcomed the three castaways, Thomas Pamphlett, Richard Parsons and John Finnegan, who had been blown off course in a storm. These men had been collecting cedar for the Sydney Penal Colony and were eventually thrown ashore at Moreton Island. After many privations, they arrived at present day Redcliffe where they lived with the Aboriginals of the Ningy Ningy clan for three months. Later they lived with the Joondoobarrie clan on Bribie Island where they were rescued by John Oxley in November of the same year. The Red Cliffs is a historical novel which describes the interaction of the Ningy Ningy and Joondoobarrie people with these three castaways before they were rescued and when Pamphlett returned as a convict at the Moreton Bay Penal settlement in 1827. The convicts were viewed as outcasts of their society, just as the tallabilla were outcasts of the Aboriginal society. The red cliffs were known as the cliffs of running blood, or Kau-in Kau-in, by the Aboriginal people and these cliffs witnessed the shedding of the blood of the convicts and of their people.", "checkins": 1, "title": "The red cliffs : a story of Moreton Bay 1799-1830", "notes": "", "author": "Mary R.

Most of the houses in which we had grown up had vanished, as had the stores from which we had stolen, the basements in which we had first tried sex, the rooftops from which we had hurled tin cans and bricks. But houses exactly like the houses of our past yet dominated the landscape, boys exactly like the boys we once had been found themselves smothering in these houses, came down into the streets for light and air and found themselves encircled by disaster. Some escaped the trap, most didn't. Those who got out always left something of themselves behind, as some animals amputate a leg and leave it in the trap. It might be said, perhaps, that I had escaped, after all, I was a school teacher; or that Sonny had, he hadn't lived in Harlem for years. Yet, as the cab moved uptown through streets which seemed, with a rush, to darken with dark people, and as I covertly studied Sonny's face, it came to me that what we both were seeking through our separate cab windows was that part of ourselves which had been left behind. It's always at the hour of trouble and confrontation that the missing member aches.We hit 110th Street and started rolling up Lenox Avenue.

The subway was too congested at Columbus Circle, and so I walked toward Lincoln Center, to catch the train at its next uptown stop. At Sixty-second Street, I fell in with a lithe man with graying sideburns who carried a plastic bag with a tag on it and was visibly exhausted, limping on slightly bowed legs. He wore shorts and black tights, and a blue, long-sleeved fleece jacket. From his features, I guessed he was Mexican or Central American. We walked in silence for a while, not intentionally walking together but finding ourselves moving at the same pace and in the same direction. Eventually, I asked him whether he had just finished the race and, when he nodded and smiled, congratulated him. But, I began to think, after twenty-six miles and 385 yards, he had simply collected his bag, and was walking home. There were no friends or family present to celebrate his achievement. I pitied him, then. Speaking again, deflecting these private thoughts, I asked if it had been a good race. Yes, he said, a good race, the conditions were good for running, not too hot.

It must face either north-west of south-west (more or less) and stand on a steep hillside so that its back appears much higher than its front. Mr. Davies suggests the house must be on the extreme southern borders of Upper Norwood and, must not be too far from the railway yet not too close to a police station. After an extensive search, Mr. Davies identified Kilravock House on Ross Road as the true \"Pondicherry Lodge\". Today, eight flats occupy Kilravock. Its roofline has been modified, the surrounding wall torn down, and the extensive grounds sold off.
